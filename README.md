# Udacity Neighbourhood Map Project

A single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit.

## Running the application locally

For security reasons, the google maps wont run locally. If you want to run it locally, then replace the app key with your own. ( Change it in index.html:42)

```<script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=places&key=APPKEY&v=3&callback=initMap"></script>```
