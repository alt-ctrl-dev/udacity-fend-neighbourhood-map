# Udacity Neighbourhood Map Project

A single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit.

## Using the app

There are three buttons in the app:
- the Search button (Top Left corner)
  - This button opens up a list of searchable points of interest. Clicking any of these points focuses on the point on the map.
- the Weather button (Top Right corner)
  - Shows the current weather in Melbourne
- the Recenter button (Bottom Right corner)
  - Recenters the map

## Running the application locally

For security reasons, the google maps wont run locally. If you want to run it locally, then replace the app key with your own. ( Change it in index.html:42)

```<script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=places&key=APPKEY&v=3&callback=initMap"></script>```
